# VACS: The Vector Addition Computation System
## Synopsis:
VACS or Vector Addition Computation System is a Java program built using Notepad++. It is a GUI port of the C++ program Vector Addition Solver. This program adds multiple two dimensional vectors together with the user specifying how many vectors to add because the amount of vectors is unknown at compilation. Please note the for the angle of a vector, the polar coordinate system is used.

## Motivation:
The main purpose of this project was to build a Java GUI application without the help of an integrated development environment (IDE). This is extremely useful because and integrated development environment graphical user interface (GUI) builder sometimes requires source code modification in order to produce the correct GUI or fix bugs. This project is also a  graphical user interface port of the project [Vector Addition Solver](https://github.com/kgorgi/Vector-Addition-Solver).

## Installation: 
VACS is supported on a variety of systems. To use VACS with Mac OS X please download and run the "VACS_for_Mac.zip" file. To use VACS with Windows please download and run the "VACS_for_Windows.exe" file. For all other operating systems that support Java 8 SE Runtime Environment, download and run the "VACS.jar" file. (Note: All file downloads above can be found in the releases tab)
